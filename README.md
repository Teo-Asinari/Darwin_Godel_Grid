# Gridworld_Agent_Experiments
This repo was originally meant to be a simple implementation of Darwin-Godel Machines in GridWorld. 
As I learned more about [that project](https://github.com/jennyzzt/dgm), it seemed solving gridworld was too simple to warrant that approach,
so I experimented with implementing different classical approaches instead.
These include:
- A-star
- Tabular Q-learning (for small grids)
- Deep Q-learning

I heavily used LLMs to speed up development. The code is entirely written through a mixture of chatgpt and cursor agent prompting.
As such, there is some repetition. But the A-star implementation is textbook.

The experience of working this way was pretty disorienting at times. I realize the main bottleneck here is my own working memory and 
code reading-comprehension speed.
